Using a variety of image processing techniques within the spatial and frequency domain to enhance and reduce the noise within two provided sample images. A custom application was successfully developed in Java and implemented filters within both domains, ultimately the periodic and random noise was reduced within the both sample images and the mean square error was calculated.

Filters within the spatial domain took advantage of 2D array manipulations and neighbourhoods. 
The frequency domain filters utilised an open-source Fourier Transform Java library named Catalono.
